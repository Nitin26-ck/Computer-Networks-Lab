Given a graph, each node A knows the shortest path to node Z and node A can determine its shortest path to Z by calculating the minimum cost.
Now when packet flows through a path it incurs some cost to the network, find shortest paths from src to all nodes in the given graph using Bellman Ford Algorithm.
The graph may contain negative weight edges
